    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>

    This first week has not been what I expected, but in a good way. Git can be surprisingly complicated,
    but very useful once you get used to it, and figuring it out was very satisfying.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>

    I am especially looking forward to learning how to program in languages such as Python and JavaScript.
    That said, learning about Git and GitHub has also been quite interesting and I am excited for all the
    material that we will cover.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
    </h3>

    I graduated from California State University Northridge in 2022 with a degree in mechanical engineering.
    However, I quickly came to realize that working as an engineer was not quite what I thought it would be,
    and decided to attend a coding bootcamp since programming is something I have enjoyed and found interesting
    whenever I have come across it.

    I am a huge roller coaster enthusiast, and that interest was what initially inspired me to pursue an
    engineering degree. I enjoy using software such as No Limits 2 to create my own roller coaster designs.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the
      coding skills to
      accomplish?
    </h3>

    One thing I would really like making with the right coding skills is videogame mods, in particular Pokemon romhacks.
    I
    enjoy playing games with mods to enhance gameplay and provide a different experience after playing the game for a
    long
    time. Being able to make my own would be really cool.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">What are you struggling with?</h3>

    The biggest thing I struggle with is time management. I have ADHD and am easily distracted, so I often struggle at
    the
    beginning of each week when I look at everything to be done at once and it seems insurmountable. Once I manage to
    get
    started, I have an easier time focusing on each individual step and seeing the mountain of work ahead get smaller.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">How do you solve a problem? </h3>

    If the first few ideas that come to mind don't work, I like to go on a walk and think
    about things. I either replay the problem in my mind and eventually an idea for a
    solution comes to me, or I clear my mind and think about other things and come back
    ready to attack the problem again, which helps me think more easily.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?</h3>

    When I get stuck, I usually think of a couple ideas to try right away. If they don't work, I try to Google the
    problem
    and I can sometimes find an answer. If that doesn't work, I take a walk as I mentioned above. If I still can't solve
    the problem, I post it in the Help channel in Slack. Everyone has been very helpful in
    giving each other ideas to solve problems.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in
      the process of rendering
      content and providing a user experience?</h3>

    I find it very interesting how several types of coding can come together to affect how a webpage looks and works. It
    is incredible what styles and effects can be achieved with only a few lines of code.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</h3>

    My blog does not currently incorporate any elemets from CSS or JavaScript, but I use html headers and text alignment
    for the question titles.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?</h3>

    The daily standup sessions helped to gauge how much work I should have done each day,
    and everyone was extremely helpful when I posted in the Slack help channel.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">What hindered your progress during Onboarding?</h3>

    One big problem for me during onboarding was staying focused and on top of my work. Now that the bootcamp is fully
    in-person, I think this should be less of an issue for me.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</h3>

    Whenever I got stuck during a project, I would take a walk and clear my mind. Sometimes the solution would come to
    me
    out of nowhere, and other times I would come back and be ready to attack the problem again with clearer thinking.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</h3>

    The main thing that held me back was not initially knowing how to render HTML content from JavaScript, but I enjoyed
    learning how to do that and I was able to get my mind reader working with a relatively small amount of HTML.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript
      (JSON, Data
      Structures),
      Bootstrap or Atomic Design?</h3>

    I would like to learn more about positioning objects in Bootstrap. Getting objects in the right place was difficult
    for me and it felt hard to understand at times.

    <h3 class='blog-question' align="center">What is your "why"?</h3>

    There are a few things that keep me motivated to keep coming each day and working hard. One is that programming is
    something I enjoy and find engaging, much more so than what I was doing before as an engineer. Another is that I
    would
    like to work a remote or hybrid job, which was not really possible in my previous field due to the need to
    communicate
    with manufacturers.
