<h3 align="center">What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?</h3>



<h3 align="center">If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you have benefited?</h3>

I think starting with Python and then switching to JS would have been harder for me; JS has a more compllicated syntax and I would probably encouner a lot of errors
due to things like forgetting to use keywords to declare variables or using '==' instead of '==='.
