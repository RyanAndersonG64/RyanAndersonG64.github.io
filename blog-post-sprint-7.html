        <h3 class='blog-question'>What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?</h3>

        They have many similar commands and keywords, and the coding logic is verfy similar between the two of them. One
        area where they differ is that Python's syntax is much
        simpler; variables are assigned with keywords in Python, and code blocks are defined solely by indentation.
        Python requires more careful management of code structure
        since it is less 'user friendly' in how code is read.

        <h3 class='blog-question'>If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be
            different? Would you have benefited?</h3>

        I think starting with Python and then switching to JS would have been harder for me; JS has a more compllicated
        syntax and I would probably encouner a lot of errors
        due to things like forgetting to use keywords to declare variables or using '==' instead of '==='.

        <h3 class='blog-question'>Think of a project or tech based tool that you use often and think about what the
            database
            structure might look like for it. Do you feel like you have a better understanding of how it works now and
            could you see yourself enjoying building something like that in the future?</h3>

        I watch a of YouTube videos, both for learning and entertainment. The database would include a table of creators
        and which videos belong to them, as well as viewer accounts and who they are subscribed to.
        I don't think I would want to build a video hosting platform, but I have some ideas for other web apps/sites
        that I would be interested in building.
