        <h3 class='blog-question'>Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?</h3>

        I have found that they are difficult to learn because the syntax can be complicated and you have to keep track
        of many moving parts in different places,
        but once I figure it out they are fairly easy to use.

        <h3 class='blog-question'>What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?</h3>

        I don't know of any particular ones that I am interested in, but I would like to learn the most commonly used
        ones.

        <h3 class='blog-question'>Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in
            your
            final project.</h3>

        In addition to VSCode and DevTools which we have been using for the entire bootcamp, I would like to incorporate
        some bundlers
        and documentation software into my projects since they would help with organization, which I am usually not good
        about.
