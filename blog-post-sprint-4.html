<h3 align="center">Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?</h3>

I have found that they are difficult to learn because the syntax can be complicated and you have to keep track of many moving parts in different places,
but once I figure it out they are fairly easy to use.

<h3 align="center">What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?</h3>

I don't know of any particular ones that I am interested in, but I would like to learn the most commonly used ones.

In addition to VSCode and DevTools which we have been using for the entire bootcamp, I would like to incorporate some bundlers
and documentation software into my projects since they would help with organization, which I am usually not good about.
