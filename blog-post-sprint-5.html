        <h3 class='blog-question'>What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?</h3>

        I have not yet learned a lot about CLIs, but they do not seem scary. I am more comfortable with back end
        devolopment than front end since it is pure logic and problem-solving without having to worry much about
        creative design.

        <h3 class='blog-question'>If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?</h3>

        I do not know enough about CLIs to provide an insightful answer to this question. It would do what others do in
        a way that is as simple and user-friendly as possible.

        <h3 class='blog-question'>List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code</h3>

        Any app or site that requires user input would be much more difficult to code without frameworks since most of
        it would have to be hard-coded.
