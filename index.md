<h3 align="center">Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>

  This first week has not been what I expected, but in a good way.  Git can be surprisingly complicated,
but very useful once you get used to it, and figuring it out was very satisfying.

<h3 align="center">What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>

  I am especially looking forward to learning how to program in languages such as Python and JavaScript.
That said, learning about Git and GitHub has also been quite interesting and I am excited for all the
material that we will cover.

<h3 align="center">What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</h3>

  I graduated from California State University Northridge in 2022 with a degree in mechanical engineering. 
However, I quickly came to realize that working as an engineer was not quite what I thought it would be, 
and decided to attend a coding bootcamp since programming is something I have enjoyed and found interesting
whenever I have come across it.

  I am a huge roller coaster enthusiast, and that interest was what initially inspired me to pursue an
engineering degree.  I enjoy using software such as No Limits 2 to create my own roller coaster designs.
