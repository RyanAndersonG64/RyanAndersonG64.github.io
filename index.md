<h3 align="center">Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>

  This first week has not been what I expected, but in a good way.  Git can be surprisingly complicated,
but very useful once you get used to it, and figuring it out was very satisfying.

<h3 align="center">What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>

  I am especially looking forward to learning how to program in languages such as Python and JavaScript.
That said, learning about Git and GitHub has also been quite interesting and I am excited for all the
material that we will cover.

<h3 align="center">What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</h3>

  I graduated from California State University Northridge in 2022 with a degree in mechanical engineering. 
However, I quickly came to realize that working as an engineer was not quite what I thought it would be, 
and decided to attend a coding bootcamp since programming is something I have enjoyed and found interesting
whenever I have come across it.

  I am a huge roller coaster enthusiast, and that interest was what initially inspired me to pursue an
engineering degree.  I enjoy using software such as No Limits 2 to create my own roller coaster designs.

<h3 align="center">What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?</h3>

One thing I would really like making with the right coding skills is videogame mods, in particular Pokemon romhacks.  I enjoy playing games with mods to enhance gameplay and provide a different experience after playing the game for a long time.  Being able to make my own would be really cool.

<h3 align="center">What are you struggling with?</h3>

The biggest thing I struggle with is time management.  I have ADHD and am easily distracted, so I often struggle at the beginning of each week when I look at everything to be done at once and it seems insurmountable.  Once I manage to get started, I have an easier time focusing on each individual step and seeing the mountain of work ahead get smaller.

<h3 align="center">How do you solve a problem? </h3>

If the first few ideas that come to mind don't work, I like to go on a walk and think
about things.  I either replay the problem in my mind and eventually an idea for a
solution comes to me, or I clear my mind and think about other things and come back
ready to attack the problem again, which helps me think more easily.

<h3 align="center">What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?</h3>

When I get stuck, I usually think of a couple ideas to try right away.  If they don't work, I try to Google the problem and I can sometimes find an answer.  If that doesn't work, I take a walk as I mentioned above.  If I still can't solve the problem, I post it in the Help channel in Slack.  Everyone has been very helpful in
giving each other ideas to solve problems.

<h3 align="center">What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing a user experience?</h3>

I find it very interesting how several types of coding can come together to affect how a webpage looks and works. It is incredible what styles and effects can be achieved with only a few lines of code.

<h3 align="center">What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</h3>

My blog does not currently incorporate any elemets from CSS or JavaScript, but I use html headers and text alignment for the question titles.

<h3 align="center">What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?</h3>

The daily standup sessions helped to gauge how much work I should have done each day,
and everyone was extremely helpful when I posted in the Slack help channel.

<h3 align="center">What hindered your progress during Onboarding?</h3>

One big problem for me during onboarding was staying focused and on top of my work.  Now that the bootcamp is fully in-person, I think this should be less of an issue for me.

<h3 align="center">How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</h3>

Whenever I got stuck during a project, I would take a walk and clear my mind.  Sometimes the solution would come to me out of nowhere, and other times I would come back and be ready to attack the problem again with clearer thinking.
