<h3 align="center">Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past?
    What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?</h3>

The biggest hurdle for me in the first half of the bootcamp was React. For some reason, it just did not click with me
and I needed a lot of help to get through the React projects.

<h3 align="center">Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the
    same ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your limitations?
</h3>

I haven't thought a lot about my final project because I don't know what the scale of it is supposed to be. With the way
my brain works, I can't
really think about project ideas until we discuss it in class and I know what the scale should be, what the final
version should like like and what
tech stack will be used.

<h3 align="center">What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in
    JavaScript?</h3>

Before this week, I had heard that Python was very simple and therefore unforgiving. I was surprised that it was not
that much less complex than JavaScript and that
it had many of the same tools for handling strings.
