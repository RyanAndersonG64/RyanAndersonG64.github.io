<h3 align="center">What are you struggling with the most in the Tech Stack so far and why?</h3>

The biggest thing I have struggled with has been React.  For some reason it just doesn't click with me, and I tend to get lost in the flow of it

<h3 align="center">What companies or people (local or not) would you like to hear talk during a Bootcamp lunch and learn?</h3>

There are no specific people I am interested in, but I would like to hear more from recruiters and other people involved in the hiring process.
I would also be interested in hearing more from previous bootcamp students who have since gotten jobs in the field.

<h3 align="center">After having built your first full-stack application, what things in your repertoire are a sticking point for you? Were you able to reconnect your React Restaurant to your Backend Bistro code? If so, what was that like, and if not, what hurdles did you need to jump?</h3>

As stated above, React has been my main sticking point.  It was not difficult for me to set up my backend database and perform calls to it, but I had difficulty setting up React
to post back to the database.
