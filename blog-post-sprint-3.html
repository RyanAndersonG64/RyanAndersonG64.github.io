        <h1 class = 'blog-question'>Pseudocode</h1>

        When you begin a coding project, it can seem daunting to sit down and think about how to go from nothing to a
        fully finished, working app or webpage. One of
        the methods that programmers use to make this process easier is writing pseudocode. Pseudocode helps to break
        down the project into steps that are easy to
        understand and isolate.

        <h2 class = 'blog-question'>What is pseudocode?</h2>

        Pseudocode is the very first stage of programming, but it remains useful throughout the coding process.
        Initially, pseudocode is used to define the problem
        in plain, human-readable language in order to brainstorm a solution. The next step is to outline a 'code' in
        plain language (i.e. 'I will use a for loop
        from 0 to 10 to double each number'). This is used to inform the coding process as line of pseudocode are turned
        into actual code. As the code develops
        and errors are encountered, the pseudocode can be used to brainstorm fixes or changes to the original idea.

        In addition to brainstorming code, pseudocode can also contain general information such as a list of what else
        needs to be done on the project or even lines
        of positive self-talk to help the programmer through the process.

        <h2 class = 'blog-question'>How does pseudocode help with programming?</h2>

        Pseudocode makes programming much easier in a variety of ways. Firstly, it helps to break down the project into
        smaller steps that the programmer can focus
        on one at a time. This makes it easier to avoid getting overwhelmed by the scale of the project since the
        progammer is focused on just getting the current
        step done and working. Within each step, it then helps the programmer to visualize what code to write by writing
        lines of 'code' in plain language and then
        thinking through what commands would perform the desired action.
